Managed Payments has additional compliance requirements and restrictions beyond those for [Stripe Payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments). To use Managed Payments, your account, products, customers, and transactions must meet the eligibility requirements described below.

## Account eligibility for Managed Payments

To use Managed Payments, your account must meet the following requirements:

- **Business eligibility**: Stripe determines access to Managed Payments based on an eligibility review that considers factors such as business type and geography.
- **Business type**: Managed Payments supports direct integrations only. It doesn’t support the following account configurations:
  - Connect platforms
  - Express accounts
  - Accounts controlled by a platform
- **Geographic eligibility**: Your business must be based in one of the supported business locations.

### Supported business locations

### North America

### Europe

### Asia Pacific

## Product eligibility for Managed Payments

To use Managed Payments on a Checkout Session or Payment Link, the products sold must be eligible for Managed Payments.

### Supported product categories

Managed Payments supports the sale of digital products. Supported categories are determined by the eligible tax codes listed below and include:

- Software
- Video games
- Digital media, such as audiobooks, e-books, digital magazines and newspapers, audio and video content, and digital images or artwork
- Online courses and training
- Electronically supplied business and web services, such as website hosting

### Unsupported product categories

Managed Payments doesn’t support non-digital product categories, including:

- Physical goods
- Professional services, such as consulting, marketing, design, development, or tech support
- Live in-person events

### Additional digital sales requirements

All eligible products must also meet the following requirements:

- You sell the product directly to customers, not through a platform or marketplace.
- You hold all necessary rights and licenses to distribute the product.
- You sell a fully automated digital product. If your service involves human intervention (such as live 1-1 coaching), it doesn’t qualify as a digital product that Managed Payments supports. If Stripe determines that your product is ineligible for Managed Payments, we’ll notify you that you’re responsible for any indirect tax liability for the product and you must discontinue the use of Managed Payments for that product.

### Product tax code requirements

You must assign an eligible tax code from the supported digital goods categories below for each product sold with Managed Payments. Set the tax code on the product in the Dashboard or using the API.
